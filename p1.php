    <h2>In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do.</h2>
    <p>I work for an industrial supply company as a strategy and operations manager. I am responsible for finding ways to improve our customer experience and running the Sales Operations department.</p>

    <h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
    <p>I'm taking this course because I've always had a lot of ideas for web projects but have never gone forward with them. A big reason I haven't moved forward is with my lack of experience with dynamic web applications. </p>

    <h2>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h2>
    <p>I was an information systems major in college so I do have some web based development experience but it's been years since I've coded anything. I have taken intermediate level courses for Java in the past.</p>

    <h2>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h2>
    <p>I'm mostly working on a Mac though I have a PC at home.</p>

    <h2>Anything else we should know?</h2>
    <p>I'm really excited for the course! However, I'll be out of the country starting tomorrow until October 2nd so I'm a bit unsure how P2 will work for me.</p>
